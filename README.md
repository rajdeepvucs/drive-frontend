*   Folder Creation within the currently selected folder.
*   File Download.
*   File Update (Replace content).
*   File & Folder Deletion (with confirmation).
*   User feedback via Toast notifications.
*   Basic responsive table layout for items.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

*   **Framework/Library:** React.js (using Vite or Create React App)
*   **Routing:** React Router DOM (`react-router-dom`)
*   **API Client:** Axios
*   **UI Notifications:** React Toastify (`react-toastify`)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (or specify if using basic CSS/other libraries)
*   **(Optional) Icons:** React Icons (`react-icons`)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
2.  **Running Backend:** The backend application **must** be running and accessible. See the backend's README for setup instructions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone the main project repository.
2.  **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/google-drive-clone/frontend
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR if using yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

## üîß Configuration

The frontend needs to know the URL of the running backend API.

1.  **API Base URL:** Open the following file:
    `frontend/src/services/api.js` (or your equivalent API configuration file)

2.  **Verify/Update `API_BASE_URL`:** Ensure the `API_BASE_URL` constant points to your running backend server. The default is often:
    ```javascript
    // Inside src/services/api.js
    const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'; // <-- CHANGE THIS PORT if your backend runs elsewhere (e.g., 5001)
    ```
    **This URL must match the address and port where your backend server is listening.**

3.  **(Optional) Environment Variables:** For more robust configuration, especially for different environments (development, production), you could use environment variables:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.
    *   Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` (if using Vite) or `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` (if using Create React App).
    *   Update `src/services/api.js` to read this variable: `const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';` (Vite example).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application (Development)

1.  **Start the Development Server:** Make sure you are in the `frontend` directory.
    ```bash
    # If using Vite
    npm run dev

    # If using Create React App
    npm start
    ```
2.  **Open in Browser:** The application should automatically open in your default browser, or you can navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173` for Vite
